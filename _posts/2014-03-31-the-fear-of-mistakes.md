As long is I can remember I have been afraid of making a mistake, from day to day talk to the time when I commit my source code.
I always wanted to be as confident as other people that I have seen, getting in front of a significant amount of people and talk
100% sure that they're right; and a lot of cases I thought to myself, why not? 

Why not?
===
Beause even when other people could do it my fear of being corrected and "put in shame" was bigger than any other feeling.
That's why I practically never liked to make any of my source code public or my level of stress skyrocketed when I was about
to send a pull request that was going to be reviewed.
A few months ago I saw a quote that was said to be from Albert Einstein that said "Whoever has never been wrong, never tried anything new",
I have seen that plenty of times before, but it never hit me like that day; that day I had no more excuses.

Opening my eyes to OSS
===
I'm a long time a consumer of OSS, since I started to program to be exact, I have made vary small contributions to it, which currently
is starting to weight in my shoulders, it's starting to feel like I'm eating for free everyday, that's why I decided to start giving 
something back to the community, in hopes to be forgiven for this long time of selfishness.

Let me shake the dust, NOT!
===
The first thing that comes to mind, while writing this, is that whoever, if ever someone reads this blog post, to be nice and bear
with my opinions; but no, that's again the fear of being wrong who's talking; so please, don't be nice.
